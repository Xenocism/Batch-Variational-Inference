# Batch-Variational-Inference
This is a basic implementation of Batch-Variational Inference in order to orient myself for more complex models of Variational Inference. It assumes a radomly slected points from a mixture model of three univariate Gaussians of 2 dimension (althogh the provided code is extensible to higher dimensions assuming those dimensions are similarly univariate)
