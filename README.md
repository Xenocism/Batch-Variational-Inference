# Batch-Variational-Inference
This is a basic implementation of Batch-Variational Inference in order to orient myself for more complex models of Variational Inference. It assumes a randomly selected points from a mixture model of three univariate Gaussians of 2 dimensions (although the provided code is extensible to higher dimensions assuming those dimensions are similarly univariate)
